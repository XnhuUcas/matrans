Description: Transfer learning, as a prevailing technique in computer sciences, aims to improve the performance of target model by leveraging auxiliary information from heterogeneous source data. We provide novel tools for multi-source transfer learning under some statistical models based on frequentist model averaging strategy, including generalized linear models, partially linear models. Unlike existing transfer learning approaches, this method can adaptively integrate the auxiliary information through data-driven weight assignments to avoid negative transfer. This is the first package for transfer learning based on the optimal model averaging frameworks, providing efficient implementation for practitioners in multi-source data modeling.
